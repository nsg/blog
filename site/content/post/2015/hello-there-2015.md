Hello there, once again a year has passed. It has been an interesting year with new technologies and new a lot of new things for me to learn. I think this year will mark the year when I switch this blog over to English as the primary language, I will still write in Swedish from time to time.

[Last year I wrote](/2014/01/06/hej-2014/) about the lack of activity in this blog, and that was still the case during 2014. I took the time to rewrite and redesign the entire blog platform with a few hack and scripts that I have written, combined with a few plugins and a excellent small CMS that I like. I will leave the details about that to a separate blog post.

I still work for [South Pole](http://www.southpole.se), and I’m still sitting as a consultant at the same company. I never mentioned it last year but the company in question is [SVT](http://www.svt.se), or SVTi to be more precise. SVTi is the subdivision of SVT that makes all the modern web related things like the web page, the play services and so on… last year I never guessed that I still would be there a year later, it never was intended as a long stay but I’m still there and I’m happy. I may write more about that in a future blog post.

I have now celebrated over a full year at my new apartment, properly furnitured for almost a year. Have done a lot of fun things, but still there is a lot of things that I’m almost ashamed about. You know that mirror, or that painting, still standing in a corner. That box that I never unpacked… oh well, a new year now, a new year to do all these things.

I talked about my new camera last year, and my new zoom lens. I have had a lot of fun with these. Especially the zoom, that was a good purchase. Maybe time to finally upload all these pictures to a showcase somewhere on the net, sometime, somewhere.

I left the country three times last year, first time was in the end of January when I went to [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) (Brussels, Belgium) with colleagues from South Pole, it was a fun trip and we plan to go again this year. The next time was a private trip with a friend to Barcelona (Spain) during the summer, a excellent town with a lot of fun things to do in. Finally I went to Berlin to visit the conference [DevOpsDays](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2014-berlin/) with colleagues from SVT, I intentionally stayed there two days extra to explore the town.

Over all, nothing big and spectacular have happened during the year but I have grown as a person, learned A LOT of new things and have had fun. 2014 was a great year and I hope that 2015 will be even better!
