In my Ubuntu Touch Phone experiment I have activated plan b, I have since yesterday reverted back to Android and this is why.

My Meizu is still a interesting phone, fast with a nice screen and good camera (compared to my earlier phones). It's super nice to have a real operating system there that I can manage like a normal computer. I like the idea to get some alternatives in between Android and iOS. But in the end of the day it's a tool, it's there to make my life easier not harder.

It started with Twitter, when I moved phones back in September I installed the Twitter client on my work phone (Nexus 5X) and have been using it browsing the feed in bed, and on the subway. I then started to bring my work phone to meetings with me because I liked to have the ability to read messages, check calendar events and of course read emails while I was running around the office floor. Some times I had two phones in my pocked but it was not unusual that I just walked around with the work phone.

I had spent a lot of time to try to solve the problems above, especially the calender but I have not to date found a reliable solution that works.

Later on I started to use the work phone more and more for browsing the web and started to use it almost as a primary phone and I was considering installing a podcast application there when I realized that I was moving in to my work phone, I was going back to Android without realizing it.

I did consider for a while to continue and move everything over to my work phone, forward the phone calls and be done with it. The 5X works fine, it's a excellent phone. The thing is, I like to keep my work and private phone separate so I went with the original "plan b", buy "this years nexus", if my experiment failed.

Google never made a Nexus this year, and by the look of it they will never again. The new models of phones are the high-end new line of phones called Pixel. Expensive yes, but I must say really an awesome phone. Bought it with some help from a friend (not available in Sweden for some unknown reason) and got it in my hands yesterday. I have not had that much time to test everything yet but I must day that I'm really happy. And it's small, a little taller than my Nexus 5, but less wide so it's less noticeable in my pockets.

My Ubuntu Phone will live on as a test and fun phone, something to experiment and try out the platform from time to time. There are still plenty of fun things you can do with it. If something interesting happens I'm sure that I will write about it here.
