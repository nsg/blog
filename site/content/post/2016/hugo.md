So I have once again changed things, this time I migrated the blog to [Hugo][1], a easy to use static website engine. I also took the time to look through the archive and there are a lot of broken content, probably from the wordpress to pico migration, need to fix that, some day.

Hugo has a nice collection of [themes][2] and I liked one called [Angel's Ladder][3], a easy clean modern looking theme built for blogs, it will do just fine!
