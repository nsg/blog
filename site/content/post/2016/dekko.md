Dekko is the default installed email client provided by Canonical, I added my email credentials (just email address and password) and it figured everything out by it self. Probably because I have a autoconfig.xml hosted at my email server, or maybe it guessed my quite standard setup.

It has overall a nice UI, and it will do the job. I mostly consume email at the phone, but I like to be able to send email from time to time. I have used it no more than 5 minutes total and I have already found a few bugs like, I’m unable to remove or replace the signature, notifications are broken and sent mails are never stored on my server.

Early days and bugs are expected, there are open source projects with bug trackers where they are discussed. I’m remembered about the good old days where we had these problems in desktop Linux.

Yup, over all, this client will work for me for my personal email needs.
