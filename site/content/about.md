I like to write from time to time and have used this space since 2005 to write about various things in my life. If there is a theme to this blog, it's things that I find interesting.

I have a background in system administration and programming, turned product owner, turned IT architect. I have built computers and played with servers since my early teens. When I started working, I built and administered HPC clusters, and later moved on to more classic servers.

I love to write code, mostly around Linux, and find containers, security, and provisioning interesting. I have spent a considerable amount of time with these topics both professionally and privately.

I prefer my own cloud over the public kind, both for privacy and fun reasons. I have gotten a little more pragmatic with age, realizing that I have to prioritize what to spend my time on.

## Social Media

I primarily use my self-hosted Mastodon server at [@nsg@nsg.cc](https://mastodon.app.stefanberggren.se/@nsg) for my social media needs. Before that, [Twitter (nsgb)](https://twitter.com/nsgb) served a similar role, but I have mainly stopped checking there. I also have a [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nsgb.bsky.social) account that is more or less just reserved.

## Code Hosting

I claimed my username at [GitHub](https://github.com/nsg) when it was brand new, but did not really use it until three years later. In 2023, I claimed an account at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nsg). I also have a more or less unused [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nsgb) account.

## E-mail

I have run my own e-mail server for about ten years. If you would like to email me, just send a message to nsg at this domain. I hope that I can [respond](@/post/2024/email.md).
