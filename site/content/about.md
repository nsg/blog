I like to write from time to time and I have used this space since 2005 to write about various things in my life. If there is a theme to this blog, it's things that I find interesting.

I have a background in system administration and programming, I have built computers and played with servers since my early teens. When I started working I built and administrated HPC clusters, and later moved on to more classic servers.

I love to write code, mostly around Linux, and I find containers, security and provisioning interesting I have spent a considering amount of time with this both professionally and privately.

I prefer my own cloud over the public kind, both for privacy and fun reasons. I have got a little more pragmatic getting older realizing that I have to prioritize on what to spend my time on.
