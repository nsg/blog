I like to write from time to time and I have used this space since 2005 to write about various things in my life. If there is a theme to this blog, it's things that I find interesting.

I have a background in system administration and programming, I have built computers and played with servers since my early teens. When I started working I built and administrated HPC clusters, and later moved on to more classic servers.

I love to write code, mostly around Linux, and I find containers, security and provisioning interesting I have spent a considering amount of time with this both professionally and privately.

I prefer my own cloud over the public kind, both for privacy and fun reasons. I have got a little more pragmatic getting older realizing that I have to prioritize on what to spend my time on.

## Social Media

I use primarily my self hosted Mastodon server at [@nsg@nsg.cc](https://mastodon.app.stefanberggren.se/@nsg) for my social media needs. Before that [Twitter (nsgb)](https://twitter.com/nsgb) served a similar role but I have mainly stopped checking there. I also have a [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nsgb.bsky.social)-account that more or less just reserved.

## Code Hosting

I claimed my username at [GitHub](https://github.com/nsg) when it was brand new, but did not really use it until three years later. In 2023 I claimed an account at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nsg). I also have a more or less unused [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nsgb) account.

## E-mail

I run my own e-mail server since ten or so years ago. If you like to email me just email nsg at this domain. I hope that I can [respond](@/post/2024/email.md).
