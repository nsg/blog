This is my [3rd](/tags/covid/) COVID post since the start. It feel so strange how things have normalized for me. I recently took my 3rd shoot of the vaccine. The first one was okay, but the second one resulted in me feeling really sick for a few hours with a really unproductive next day. I was worried that the 3rd shot would be the same, but this time I felt just fine. A little tired a few hours after the shot and some pain in the arm for two days, that's all!

We are in the middle of the fourth "wave" of the pandemic here in the in Sweden. The above graph shows the number of critically ill people in the hospitals. The red dots shows when I was vaccinated, I and a large part of the populous was vaccinated after the 3rd wave here in Sweden. My mother and most older and weak people was vaccinated between the 2nd and 3rd wave. The main vaccination rollout was during the green area, slowly at first with just a few and increasing. There was a lot of demand of vaccines early on, with little supply.

If we look at the number of confirmed cases the graph tells a completely different story, the 5k cases/day we had back in the 2nd and 3rd wave are had to detect compared to the 100-ish thousand reported cases now. Still most cases are mild, it's rare that someone need to go to the hospital, a week in quarantine and 
you are good to go! I'm so glad that everybody I know is vaccinated considering that the current predominant variant spreads 70 times more efficient, and there are reports of an even worse variant on the way.

The positive things are that with this many people betting affected you will soon have and complete immunity in the population, either from the vaccine and/or the decease. I really hope, and I think that we finally see the end of the tunnel.

Hang in there!
