A little after midnight I write this post. I have spent most of the evening tinkering with Kubernetes, [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) to be more precise. MicroK8s was until recently just a quick and easy way to run a single node Kubernetes cluster on your local computer for development. But it has evolved to also include more serious small scale production deployments.

... so I moved this blog over to my new shiny 3-node Kubernets cluster!
