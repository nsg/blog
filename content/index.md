## My blog

Hello there, this is my blog where I write about various things
that interests me. I mix posts written in Swedish and English.

I have blogged since 2005 and I have used a lot of different
platforms over the years. My latest blog was based on Wordpress
and it was mishandled with the lack of updates and care for years
and I realized that a static based page will fit my needs better.

I have exported the Wordpress-blog to markdown, I use [Pico CMS][1] to
render and manage the pages and hosts everything inside a Docker
container. There are no real magic here, most of the pages are 
quite static. If you are curious check out the [git repo][2] containing
the markdown files, Docker files and various config.
